# Legacy of Magic
This game is a Touhou-inspired danmaku game using the same arcade-continue style in which you, an inquisitor of the mage association, must uncover the cause of a strange series of anachronities occuring within the kingdom. Of what nature is this disaster? Who or what may be causing it? Discover for yourself as you graze past the magic of various people and creatures in this 2.5d bullet hell!

This project was developed in 8 weeks by myself, the sole developer. Only the art and some of the music was also outsourced, while some I composed myself.

# Screenshots
Coming soon.
